# Finishing Up

1. Exit the arch-chroot environment: `exit`
2. Unmount __BOOT__: `umount /mnt/boot`
3. Unmount __ROOT__: `umount /mnt`
4. Reboot and remove the USB: `reboot`

## Final words
That's it! You now have a basic working installation of arch.
It's worth noting that you, following these steps, won't have a graphical interface
but this can be added. I won't go through that in this guide but there are plenty of
resources elsewhere.
